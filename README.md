# Customer Data Security

## 1. Description
As customers increasingly adopt digital technology, the data they generate create both an opportunity for enterprises to improve their engagement and a responsibility to keep consumer data safe. These data, including location-tracking and other kinds of personally identifiable information, are immensely valuable to companies: many organizations, for example, use data to better understand the consumerâ€™s pain points and unmet needs. This research help develop new products and services, as well as to personalize advertising and marketing.

## 4. Results
Encryption using Affine Transformation doesn't do much to protect personal data due to the simplicity of matrix operation. Box-Cox Transformation potentially can give good results but data have to be balanced first. Self-Organizing Map clustering algorithm is the most advanced choice to encrypt personal information, however the labels have to be balanced as well.
