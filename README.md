# Customer Data Security

## 1. Description
As customers increasingly adopt digital technology, the data they generate create both an opportunity for enterprises to improve their engagement and a responsibility to keep consumer data safe. These data, including location-tracking and other kinds of personally identifiable information, are immensely valuable to companies: many organizations, for example, use data to better understand the consumerâ€™s pain points and unmet needs. This research help develop new products and services, as well as to personalize advertising and marketing.
